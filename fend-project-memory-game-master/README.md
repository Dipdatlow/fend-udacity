# Memory Game Project

 #

The memory game in this project is for the IPND Udacity course
Details:
1. When the first card is open, the timer start's.
2. When all cards are matched (8 matches total) a pop-up appears and show the score, timer and moves.
3. If you think you screwed up the score(while the game is on, and after the game is over too), the reset button is there to help.
4. To get the maximum star score, you have to do less than 10 moves, to 2 star score, less than 15 moves.
5. Good luck and have fun !!
